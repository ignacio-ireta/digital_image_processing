    "## Filter 1.3: Canny Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory and Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Canny edge detection is a multi-stage algorithm used to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986 and is still one of the most popular edge detection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudocode for Canny Edge Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Function CannyEdgeDetection(image, lowThreshold, highThreshold, kernelSize=5):\n",
    "    1. Noise Reduction:\n",
    "       - Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image and reduce noise\n",
    "       \n",
    "    2. Gradient Calculation:\n",
    "       - Calculate gradient magnitude and direction using Sobel operators:\n",
    "         * Apply Sobel operator in x-direction to get Gx\n",
    "         * Apply Sobel operator in y-direction to get Gy\n",
    "         * Calculate gradient magnitude: G = sqrt(Gx² + Gy²)\n",
    "         * Calculate gradient direction: θ = atan2(Gy, Gx)\n",
    "       \n",
    "    3. Non-maximum Suppression:\n",
    "       - Thin out the edges by keeping only local maxima:\n",
    "         * Discretize gradient direction into one of four angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)\n",
    "         * Compare each pixel's gradient magnitude with its neighbors along the gradient direction\n",
    "         * Suppress (set to zero) the pixel if its magnitude is not a local maximum\n",
    "       \n",
    "    4. Double Thresholding:\n",
    "       - Classify remaining pixels as strong, weak, or non-edges:\n",
    "         * Pixels with intensity > highThreshold are strong edges\n",
    "         * Pixels with intensity between lowThreshold and highThreshold are weak edges\n",
    "         * Pixels with intensity < lowThreshold are non-edges (set to zero)\n",
    "       \n",
    "    5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis:\n",
    "       - Connect edge segments by converting weak edges to strong edges:\n",
    "         * Analyze each weak edge pixel\n",
    "         * If it's connected to a strong edge pixel (directly or through other weak edge pixels), \n",
    "           keep it as an edge\n",
    "         * Otherwise, set it to zero\n",
    "       \n",

    "## Results and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the results of applying the different filters to our set of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gaussian Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual Implementation vs. OpenCV**:\n",
    "  - The manual implementation produces results very similar to OpenCV's built-in function, with slight differences likely due to border handling and floating-point precision.\n",
    "  - OpenCV's implementation is much faster due to optimized C++ code and possible hardware acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect on Images**:\n",
    "  - Successfully reduced noise in all images.\n",
    "  - Softened fine details and edges.\n",
    "  - The effect is more pronounced with larger kernel sizes and sigma values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CLAHE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect on Images**:\n",
    "  - Significantly improved local contrast in all images.\n",
    "  - Revealed details in both dark and bright regions that were not visible in the original.\n",
    "  - The histograms show a more uniform distribution of pixel intensities after CLAHE.\n",
    "  - Images with poor lighting conditions (underexposed or overexposed) benefit the most from CLAHE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sensitivity**:\n",
    "  - Higher clip limits allow more contrast but can introduce noise.\n",
    "  - Smaller tile sizes produce more localized contrast enhancement but can create block artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Canny Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect on Images**:\n",
    "  - Successfully identified significant edges in all images.\n",
    "  - Preprocessing with Gaussian smoothing helped reduce noise in the edge map.\n",
    "  - The double thresholding approach effectively filtered out weak edges while preserving important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sensitivity**:\n",
    "  - Lower thresholds detect more edges but include more noise.\n",
    "  - Higher thresholds detect fewer edges but focus on the strongest ones.\n",
    "  - The optimal threshold values depend on the image content and the specific application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential application of all three filters demonstrated a typical image processing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Smoothing**: Reduced noise and prepared the image for further processing.\n",
    "2. **CLAHE**: Enhanced local contrast, making edges more pronounced.\n",
    "3. **Canny Edge Detection**: Extracted and highlighted the significant edges in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence is particularly effective for edge detection in images with varying lighting conditions or poor contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Across Images\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different images responded differently to the same filters and parameters.\n",
    "- Images with more texture and detail showed more pronounced effects from all filters.\n",
    "- The optimal parameters for each filter varied depending on the image content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Smoothing** is an essential preprocessing step that reduces noise while preserving the overall structure of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CLAHE** is highly effective for enhancing visibility in images with poor contrast or uneven lighting. It's particularly useful for revealing details in both dark and bright regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Canny Edge Detection** provides clean and accurate edge maps, which are valuable for feature extraction, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The **combination of these filters** creates a powerful pipeline for image enhancement and feature extraction, with each filter complementing the strengths of the others."
