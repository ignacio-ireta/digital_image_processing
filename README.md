## Usage Examples

### Grayscale Conversion
```python
from PIL import Image

# Load and convert image to grayscale
image = Image.open('your_image.jpg')
grayscale = image.convert('L')
grayscale.save('grayscale_image.png')
```

### SVD Image Compression
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load image and perform SVD
image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg', 0)
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(image, full_matrices=False)
```

### Image Translation
```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Create translation matrix
translation_matrix = np.array([50, 0])  # Move 50 pixels horizontally
```
