## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital_image_processing.git
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Usage Examples

### Grayscale Conversion
```python
from PIL import Image

# Load and convert image to grayscale
image = Image.open('your_image.jpg')
grayscale = image.convert('L')
grayscale.save('grayscale_image.png')
```

### SVD Image Compression
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load image and perform SVD
image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg', 0)
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(image, full_matrices=False)
```
